## Gameplay
The game is played from a *third-person perspective*, with the player controlling the squirrel who is positioned on the center of the screen. The player can move freely across the campus, climb trees and buildings, and interact with the environment by performing actions such as collecting food, grappling onto objects, and solving puzzles. Movement includes running, climbing, and gliding between buildings, offering a fluid and dynamic traversal experience. Climbing is a key feature, allowing the squirrel to scale vertical surfaces like going up and down a tree and explore hidden areas. 

Players will engage in a variety of tasks that immerse them in the life of a campus squirrel, such as scavenging for food (nuts, snacks), navigating obstacles like traffic, bikes, and rival squirrels. Along the way, players will explore iconic campus locations and uncover hidden secrets. Objectives will range from preparing for winter by gathering supplies to completing quirky missions involving well-known campus landmarks. The low-to-the-ground perspective enhances the sense of scale and detail, encouraging players to explore every nook and cranny of the environment. Players will feel immersed in the experience of being a squirrel, burrowing through the grass, leaping between branches, and discovering the unseen side of campus life.
